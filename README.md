# exoplanet: Case Studies

This is where the case studies for
[exoplanet](https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet) live!

Contributing a case study
-------------------------

First: thank you for considering contributing a case study!

Take a look at the [exoplanet developer
docs](https://docs.exoplanet.codes/en/latest/user/dev/) for information about
how to set up your system. Then, you can fork this repo and add your case study
as a notebook to the `docs/tutorials` directory.

A few things to double check:

1. The format should follow one of the existing case studies, so start by
   duplicating one of the existing notebooks.

2. Make sure that you **clear the outputs of your notebook before committing**.
   Otherwise this repo will get unruly! I normally use
   [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) to make sure that this
   always happens.
