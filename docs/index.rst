exoplanet: Case Studies
=======================

These pages contain "case studies" for `the exoplanet project
<https://docs.exoplanet.codes>`_. Each case study is an example of a real world
application of the ``exoplanet`` library for analyzing data in astronomy. They
are implemented as Jupyter notebooks, and you can download the notebook or
launch it using `Binder <https://mybinder.org>`_ using the menus at the top
right of each case study. Note that the runtime for some of these notebooks can
be as long as an hour, but we've tried to keep the studies as self-contained and
reproducible as possible.

If you run into issues executing these case studies (or variations on them) on
your own computer, do one of the following:

- If there seems to be a bug, `open an issue on the exoplanet GitHub repo
  <https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet/issues>`_.

- If you have a conceptual issue or a particularly tricky or interesting fit,
  `start a discussion <https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet/discussions>`_.

For more information about ``exoplanet``, check out the main documentation page
at `docs.exoplanet.codes <https://docs.exoplanet.codes>`_.
