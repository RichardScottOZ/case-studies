*exoplanet* is a toolkit for probabilistic modeling of transit and/or radial
velocity observations of `exoplanets <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet>`_
and other astronomical time series using `PyMC3 <https://docs.pymc.io>`_.

The main documentation page for exoplanet can be found at `exoplanet.dfm.io
<https://exoplanet.dfm.io>`_. This page includes several case studies that are
examples of fully fledged analyses that are somewhat more computationally
expensive to run than the tutorials included in the main repository.
